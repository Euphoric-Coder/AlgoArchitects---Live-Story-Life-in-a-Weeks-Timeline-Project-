## Timeline Export (PDF Generation of Timeline)

The **Timeline Export** feature enables users to generate a visually rich, printable PDF of their life timeline, complete with milestones, events, and optional statistics. This is powered by the `jsPDF` library and a custom-built class: `TimelinePDFExporter`.

---

### How It Works

When the user clicks the **Export Timeline** button, a modal opens where they can customize the export settings. Once confirmed, the selected events and options are passed to `exportTimelineToPDF()`, which internally uses the `TimelinePDFExporter` class to generate and download a PDF file.

---

### Export Options (via ExportModal)

| Option                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Include Statistics    | Adds a summary of total events, milestones, etc.                            |
| Include Event Details | Adds full descriptions for each event in the PDF                           |
| Color Scheme          | Choose between full-color and grayscale styling                            |
| Page Size             | Select either A4 or US Letter formatting                                   |
| Orientation           | Choose between portrait or landscape layout                                |

These are passed as the `exportOptions` object to the exporter.

### Files Involved

| File                     | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ExportModal.jsx`        | Renders the export UI, collects user preferences |
| `lib/pdfExports.js`      | Contains `TimelinePDFExporter` class logic       |
| `jsPDF` dependency       | Core library for PDF creation and formatting     |

---

### PDF Export Structure

#### 1. Cover Page

- **Title**: Life Timeline
- **Subtitle**: A Visual Journey Through Time
- **Date**: Current date of export
- Styled using `addTitle()`, `addSubtitle()`, and `addText()`

---

#### 2. Timeline Visualization

Uses `addTimelineVisualization()`:
- Horizontal chart across years
- Events represented as colored or grayscale bars
- Count of events in each year
- Visualizes distribution of categories (milestone, personal, etc.)

---

#### 3. Timeline Statistics *(Optional)*

Uses `addStatistics()`:
- 2-column grid of statistic boxes
- Stats included:
  - Total Events
  - Years Covered
  - Milestones
  - Career Events
  - Personal Events
  - Travel Adventures

Each box has:
- Label
- Value
- Category-specific color bar

---

#### 4. Year-wise Event Pages

For each year (descending order):

- Starts a new page
- Uses `addTitle()` + `addSubtitle()` to show the year and event count
- Iterates through all events in that year and calls `addEventCard(event, options)`:
  - Title, date, type, and description
  - Colored left bar (or grayscale)
  - Text wraps automatically
  - Page breaks are handled via `checkPageBreak()`

---

#### ðŸ“„ 5. Footer on All Pages

- Applies via `this.pdf.setPage()`
- Shows `"Life Timeline - Page X of Y"`
- Appears on the bottom right of each page

---
